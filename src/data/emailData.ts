I'm writing to share the updated treatment protocol for cardiovascular patients that was approved at yesterday's department meeting. The new protocol incorporates the latest research findings and recommendations from the National Cardiology Association.

Key changes include:

1. Updated first-line medication recommendations
2. Modified diagnostic pathway for patients with ambiguous symptoms
3. New post-operative care guidelines with emphasis on early mobilization

Please review the attached document and implement these changes in your practice effective immediately. There will be a brief training session on Friday at 2 PM to address any questions.

Best regards,
Dr. Priya Sharma
Head of Cardiology`,

I am referring Mr. Ravi Kumar (Patient ID: P-39281) to your department for specialized orthopedic consultation. 

The patient is a 45-year-old male with persistent lower back pain that has not responded to conventional treatment over the last 3 months. MRI results show potential disc herniation at L4-L5. 

Patient history and all relevant imaging reports are attached for your review. Given the patient's worsening mobility issues, I would appreciate if you could see him at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your assistance.
